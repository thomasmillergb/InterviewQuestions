There is a hot dog eating compition, where every person is given an int ID. Everytime a person eats a hotdog an id is sent.

At the end of the compition we want to know who eat the most hotdogs, if there is a draw it should be the first person who eat the last hotdog.


Please design a solution to this interface

public interface HotDog{
    public int whoWins(int[] hotdogEatenById)
} 

A quick example

[1,2,3,1,1,2] will return 1
